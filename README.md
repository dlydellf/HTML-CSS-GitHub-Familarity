# My "Profile Website" Example
Hi!

This is a simple "profile" website I created at the beginning of my coding journey to show a basic understanding of [HTML](index.html) &amp; [CSS](main.css) skills, along with familiarity of committing, pushing, & merging via [GitHub](https://github.com/dlydellf/HTML-CSS-GitHub-Familarity/commits/main).
