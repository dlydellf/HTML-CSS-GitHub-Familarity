# My "Profile Website" Example
Hi!

This is a simple [profile](http://www.douglasforeman.me) website I created at the beginning of my coding journey to show a basic understanding of HTML &amp; CSS skills, along with familiarity of committing, pushing, & merging via GitHub.

Although not currently responsive, this repo's CSS will be updated with @media properties - creating content that's consistent across multiple devices is *expected* of professional developers.
