# My "Profile Website" Example
Hi!  This is a simple "profile" website I created very early in my coding days to show a basic understanding of HTML &amp; CSS skills, along with familiarity of committing, pushing, & merging via GitHub.

Although not currently responsive, this repo's CSS will be updated with @media properties - creating content that's consistent across multiple devices is an expectation of professional developers.
