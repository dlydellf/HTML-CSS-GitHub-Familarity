# My "Profile Website" Example
Hi!

This is a simple [profile](http://www.douglasforeman.me) website I created at the beginning of my coding journey to show a basic understanding of [HTML](index.html) &amp; [CSS](main.css) skills, along with familiarity of committing, pushing, & merging via [GitHub](https://github.com/dlydellf/HTML-CSS-GitHub-Familarity/commits/main).

Although not currently responsive, this repo's CSS will be updated with @media properties - creating content that's consistent across multiple devices is *expected* of professional developers.
